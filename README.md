# IRS_migration_data
This repository contains the data files and the python code needed to construct a complete time series of county-to-county migration flows for the period 1998-2015 based on IRS-SOI Migration Data. In addition, I've uploaded also the python scripts I've used to analyse how flows and ties changed after Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy.
